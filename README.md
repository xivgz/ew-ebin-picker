# FAQ:
\>What is an ebin?\
Ebic epin ebin posti \:DDD\
\
\>Why am I here?\
Post your character less.\
\
\>Why am I not in this list?\
Post your character more.\
\
\>There are multiple of the same person!\
If someone posts as an alt or golem constantly, I keep it in because it's too bothersome to sort out.\
I will try to limit the alts and golems per subrace at least.\
However, one-off golems like glamourer changes to ebicly reply to anchorposts shouldn't be included.\
If there is actually the same character, same eye color, same face shapes, do let me know.\
\
\>How do I let you know?\
Just complain in a reply to the picker link that gets posted, be it by me or some other shit-stirrers.\
\
\>How do I check if I made the list?\
You can check in the folders. They're kind of sorted.\
\
\>Remove me from the list!\
You shouldn't have posted your character.\
\
\>DT update when?!?!?!\
